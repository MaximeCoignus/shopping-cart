# Delicious Shopping Cart

This project is a React version I've made of this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/SomnusHermeticus/pen/ARpgOO).

## Disclaimer

All credits to [Didier](https://codepen.io/SomnusHermeticus) for the design that I just compiled from preprocessors to original HTML and CSS.

The main purpose of this project was to refactor jQuery codebase into a proper React web application.

Sliding list only works on desktop to date. Mousemove animation is still to be replaced by a horizontal scrollbar for a better mobile UX.

## Demo

Here is the link of the live version for this project: [Shopping Cart](https://delicious-shopping-cart.netlify.app/).
